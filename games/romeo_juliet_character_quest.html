                feedback: "Correct! Romeo's comparison of Juliet to the sun and eastern light shows his idealistic, romantic nature. He elevates her to divine status, seeing her as bringing light and life to his world. This metaphorical language reveals his passionate, poetic character."

                    "She's asking why he has to be Romeo (a Montague), showing her struggle with family loyalty versus love",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                feedback: "Excellent! 'Wherefore' means 'why', not 'where'. Juliet is lamenting that Romeo must be a Montague, her family's enemy. This shows her maturity in recognizing that names and family feuds are meaningless compared to true love‚Äîa significant development from the obedient daughter we first meet."

                correct: 1,
                feedback: "Perfect analysis! Mercutio's curse is prophetic‚Äîboth houses will indeed suffer tragedy. As Romeo's loyal friend who dies because of the feud (despite not being part of it), Mercutio represents how hatred spreads beyond the original participants, destroying innocent lives."

                feedback: "Brilliant understanding! The Friar uses the metaphor of fire and gunpowder (which explodes when combined) to warn that intense, impulsive passion often leads to destruction. This directly foreshadows the tragic ending and reinforces the theme that extreme emotions, even love, can be dangerous."

However, her willingness to abandon Romeo shows she doesn't understand the depth of Juliet's love. This contrast highlights Juliet's romantic idealism versus the Nurse's practical, worldly approach."
